## Install

### Composer

```bash
composer require ekreative/health-check-bundle
```

### AppKernel

Include the bundle in your AppKernel

```php
public function registerBundles()
{
    $bundles = [
        ...
        new Ekreative\HealthCheckBundle\EkreativeHealthCheckBundle(),
```

### Routing

```yaml
ekreative_health_check:
    resource: '@EkreativeHealthCheckBundle/Resources/config/routes.xml'
```

### Security

You should make sure `/healthcheck` does not require authentication

```yaml
security:
    firewalls:
        healthcheck:
            pattern: ^/healthcheck
            security: false
```

## Configuration

By default healthcheck will check that your default doctrine connection is working.

### Doctrine

To check more than one doctrine connection you should add the configuration, listing
the names of the connections

```yaml
ekreative_health_check:
    doctrine:
        - 'default'
        - 'alternative'
```

You can also list doctrine connections that should be checked, but don't cause a failure

```yaml
ekreative_health_check:
    optional_doctrine:
        - 'another.optional'
```

Its possible to disable the doctrine check

```yaml
ekreative_health_check:
    doctrine_enabled: false
```

#### Timeout

Its recommended to change the default PDO connection timeout so that your health
check will fail faster

Add this under connection setting

```yaml
doctrine:
    dbal:
        connections:
            default:
                driver: pdo_mysql
                host: '%database_host%'
                options:
                    !php/const PDO::ATTR_TIMEOUT: 5
```

### Redis

The bundle can also check that redis connections are working. You should add a list of
service names to check

This will require the PHP Redis extension enabled.

```yaml
ekreative_health_check:
    redis:
        - 'redis'
```

You can also list redis connections that should be checked, but don't cause a failure

```yaml
ekreative_health_check:
    optional_redis:
        - 'redis.optional'
```

#### Timeout

Its recommended to change the default Redis connection timeout so that your health
check will fail faster. Its the third argument to `connect` call for `\Redis`.

```yaml
services:
    redis:
        class: Redis
        calls:
            - [ connect, ['%redis_host%', '%redis_port%', 5]]
```

#### Redis

When you want redis to be optional, you might want to use the provided `RedisFactory`
(or your own) that catches any exceptions on connect. Without this a Redis failure will
cause the container to fail, resulting in a 500 error. 

```yaml
services:
    redis:
        class: Redis
        factory: Ekreative\HealthCheckBundle\DependencyInjection\RedisFactory::get
        arguments:
            $host: 'example.com'
```
